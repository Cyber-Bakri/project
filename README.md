## What I've Discovered So Far

After reviewing the Terraform files, I've mapped out a complete infrastructure that consists of two main components:

### 1. **Runtime Infrastructure** (The "Queries" Application)
This is the production application that serves GraphQL queries. It includes:
- An **ECS Fargate cluster** running Docker containers
- An **Application Load Balancer** (ALB) handling HTTPS traffic
- **Route53 DNS records** providing friendly URLs
- **ECR repository** storing container images
- **CloudWatch logging** for monitoring
- Integration with **Sumo Logic** for centralized logs

### 2. **CI/CD Pipeline** (The Build & Deployment System)
This automates the software delivery process:
- **GitHub integration** that triggers on code changes
- **CodePipeline** orchestrating the build process
- **SonarQube analysis** for code quality checks
- **CodeBuild** that builds Docker images and deploys to ECS
- Automatic deployment to the production environment

## The Complete Picture

Here's how everything connects:

1. **Developer pushes code to GitHub**
2. **GitHub webhook triggers CodePipeline**
3. **Pipeline runs SonarQube analysis** to check code quality
4. **Pipeline builds Docker image** using CodeBuild
5. **Image is pushed to ECR repository**
6. **CodeBuild deploys new version to ECS**
7. **ECS pulls the image from ECR and runs it**
8. **Load Balancer routes traffic to ECS tasks**
9. **Route53 provides DNS name for clients to access**
10. **All logs flow to CloudWatch and Sumo Logic**

## Key Infrastructure Characteristics

**High Availability:**
- Resources deployed across 3 availability zones (private subnets)
- Load balancer distributes traffic across multiple containers
- Automatic health checks and recovery

**Security:**
- Internal load balancer (not exposed to internet)
- TLS/SSL encryption (HTTPS)
- KMS encryption for container images and artifacts
- IAM roles with least-privilege access
- Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager

**Serverless:**
- No EC2 instances to manage (Fargate)
- Automatic scaling capability
- Pay only for what you use

**Observability:**
- CloudWatch logs for all components
- Centralized logging in Sumo Logic
- Container Insights for ECS monitoring
- ALB access logs stored in S3

## What This Means for Running the Workspace

Now that we understand the connections, we know that running this workspace will:
1. Create a complete containerized application infrastructure
2. Set up automated CI/CD from GitHub to production
3. Establish monitoring and logging pipelines
4. Configure secure networking and access controls
5. Enable automatic deployments on code changes

## Dependencies That Must Exist

Before running this workspace, the following must already be in place:
- **VPC** with private subnets (mrad1, mrad2, mrad3)
- **Security groups** for ECS and Lambda
- **IAM roles** for ECS execution, tasks, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline
- **KMS keys** for encryption
- **Route53 hosted zone** for DNS records
- **GitHub repository** with source code
- **Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager** (GitHub tokens, webhook secrets)
- **SonarQube server** for code analysis

## Next Steps

With this understanding, we can now:
1. **Verify all prerequisites** are in place
2. **Review the configuration variables** to ensure they match our environment
3. **Plan the Terraform run** with confidence
4. **Execute the deployment** knowing what will be created
5. **Troubleshoot any issues** by understanding the resource relationships

## Recommendation

I recommend we proceed with running the workspace in a non-production environment first to validate:
- All dependencies are correctly referenced
- The pipeline successfully builds and deploys
- The application is accessible through the load balancer
- Logging and monitoring are working correctly

Once validated, we can confidently promote this to production.
